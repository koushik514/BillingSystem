Steps followed

1. I have read the filecontents, with UTF 8 encoding inorder to parse currency symbols.
2. Split the contents of file, assuming each packaging record in each line, and value before ':' as the max allowed weight.
3. While reading the contents, created an object(PackageDetail) that has weight, index and cost of package. Applied given constraints
Max weight that a package can take is ? 100
Max weight and cost of an item is ? 100
4. Created a PackageCostComparator class(that implements Comparator)to sort the list of itemses as per cost(maximum cost being the top value in list)
Also added additional sort constraint to a package which weights less in	case there is more than	one	package	with the same price.
5. Created a class that takes input as maxAllowed weight and the list of Packagedetails to be choosen for shipping.
This class has a method which filters the best package/packages to be shipped.
6. The result is appended to a string buffer.

Additional details.
APIException is thrown, in case if file has invalid values.

Testing

Note: the files used for testing are added under src/test/resources folder. While testing the absolete path of these files is to be given in respective testcases.

Created following test cases.
1. Test that checks if the output is as expected, as per the given challenge.
2. Test that checks if the file is found, which throws fileNotFound exception.
3. Test that checks if the input format is correct, throws APIException if not correct.
4. Test that checks if the result has any indexes, when data having weight >100 is supplied.
5. Test that checks if the result has any indexes, when data having weight >100 is supplied.
6. Test that sends a package which	weighs	less in	case there is more than	one	package	with the same price
